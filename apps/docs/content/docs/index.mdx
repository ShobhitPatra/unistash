# Unistash

**Universal state management abstraction for React**

Write your state management code once. Run it with any library.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @unistash/zustand
# or @unistash/jotai, @unistash/redux, etc.
```

```tsx
import { createStore } from "@unistash/zustand";

const useCounterStore = createStore({
  state: { count: 0 },
  actions: {
    increment: (state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }),
  },
});

function Counter() {
  const { count, actions } = useCounterStore();
  return <button onClick={actions.increment}>{count}</button>;
}
```

## Why Unistash?

- 🔄 **Switch libraries instantly** - Change one import, keep your code
- 📚 **Learn once, use everywhere** - One API for all state libraries
- 🚀 **Zero vendor lock-in** - Never rewrite state logic again
- 🎯 **Perfect for OSS** - Contributors don't need to learn every library
